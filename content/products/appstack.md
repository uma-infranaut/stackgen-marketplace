## What is an AppStack?

An AppStack in StackGen is a modular approach to application deployment that allows developers to compose applications using pre-built components and infrastructure templates. It represents your application infrastructure as code in a reusable, templated form that can be deployed consistently across environments.

## Key Features

### Modular Architecture

AppStacks employ a modular architecture that separates applications into discrete, manageable components:

- **Base Infrastructure** - Common infrastructure elements shared across environments
- **Environment-specific Configurations** - Customizations for different deployment targets
- **Resource Modules** - Reusable components like databases, queues, or API gateways

### Infrastructure as Code

AppStacks generate infrastructure code automatically from visual designs:

- Terraform code generation for all major cloud providers
- Version-controlled infrastructure definitions
- Configuration drift prevention with GitOps workflows

### Multi-Cloud Support

Deploy your applications consistently across different cloud providers:

- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud
- On-premise environments

### Pre-built Templates

Start quickly with pre-built templates for common application patterns:

- Three-tier web applications
- Microservices architectures
- Serverless applications
- Data processing pipelines

## How AppStacks Work

AppStacks follow a structured approach to application deployment:

1. **Design** - Visually design your application architecture using the StackGen designer
2. **Configure** - Add environment-specific configurations and variables
3. **Generate** - Automatically generate infrastructure as code (Terraform, etc.)
4. **Deploy** - Deploy to your target environment with built-in CI/CD integration
5. **Manage** - Monitor and update your application infrastructure

## Benefits

- **Accelerated Development** - Deploy applications faster with pre-built components
- **Reduced Complexity** - Abstract away infrastructure details for developers
- **Consistent Deployments** - Ensure consistent deployment across environments
- **Cost Control** - Optimize infrastructure costs with built-in cost estimation
- **Governance** - Enforce organizational policies and security standards
- **Knowledge Preservation** - Capture and reuse organizational best practices

## Use Cases

### Application Modernization

Transform legacy applications into modern, cloud-native architectures using AppStacks to incrementally modernize components.

### Multi-Environment Deployments

Maintain consistency across development, testing, staging, and production environments with environment-specific configurations.

### Cloud Migration

Accelerate cloud migration by templating application infrastructure and deploying consistently to new cloud environments.

### DevOps Enablement

Empower development teams with self-service infrastructure deployment while maintaining governance and best practices.

## Requirements

- StackGen Platform v2.0 or higher
- Git repository for version control
- Cloud provider accounts (for deployment targets)
